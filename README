This is for the qualcom aarch64 laptop YOGA C630, with this kernel and these directions expect the following 
    WORKS;
        accelerated graphics
            panel
        audio speakers/headphones (no internal mic)
        wifi
        bluetooth
        usb
        touchpad/keyboard/touchscreen
        camera
        battery meter (the estimated time remaining, is well, bad, but percentage updates correctly every couple of min at worst)
    UNTESTED BUT POSSIBLE
        LTE cell modem (My understanding is it needs an actve sim and connection to tower with active data connection to present, i have no sim)
        DisplayPort over usb-c (I dont have a cable)
    DOESNT WORK
        Internal mic (which i believe is some sorta mic array with its own firmware "qcwdsp850.mbn"?)
        Sensor Low Power Island  (im not sure if this includes the accelerometer or just temp etc firmware files qcslpi850.mbn qcslpi850_cls.mbn ive found no patches/dev?)
        Venus video encoder/decoder (this works on sdm845 and the lead dev even emailed me back which was super awesome, like a rock star these guys are to me)

    ALL CREDIT GOES TO THE GODS AT LINARO, id list names but i dont know who everyone is and what they do. i was adding patches from at least a half dozen places
    before finding Anderssons github page. That guy must be like the Gandolph of awesome programmers, so so many patches have come from him. i digress anyway;
    This assumes you have already followed the directions from 
    https://github.com/aarch64-laptops/build
    and you have the four services installed (NEWEST POSSIBLE SOURCE REQUIRED) and you followed wifi link at
    https://github.com/aarch64-laptops/build/blob/master/misc/lenovo-yoga-c630/wifi/README.md
   

Booting the remote procs
    get the firmware from windows partition
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Celliwig/Lenovo-Yoga-c630/master/yoga_fw_extract/yoga_fw_extract.sh
        chmod +x yoga_fw_extract.sh
        ./yoga_fw_extract.sh
    kernel 5.5 and newer need a diff firmware directory
        sudo mkdir -p /lib/firmware/qcom/LENOVO/81JL
        sudo cp  /lib/firmware/qcom/c630/* /lib/firmware/qcom/LENOVO/81JL/
        we also need qcdxkmsuc850.mbn ipa_fws.elf qcvss850.mbn
    EXAMPLE; use same method to find 
        sudo find /mnt -name qcdxkmsuc850.mbn  (it may find multiple ls -la them and use the newest)
    INSTALL FIRMWARE;
        cp qcdxkmsuc850.mbn /lib/firmware/qcom/LENOVO/81JL
    ipa_fws.elf; use pil-splitter.py found in this kernels C630 folder or https://github.com/remittor/qcom-mbn-tools/blob/master/pil-splitter.py
        python2 pil-splitter.py ipa_fws.elf ipa_fws    then copy the resulting files to /lib/firmware
    qcvss850.mbn is the firmware for venus enc/dec which currently doesnt work on c630. the venus mods link to mdt_loader which means it should
    be able to load the "full" .mdt file. ive tried both split and full it loads without the metadata error but doesnt reset. eitherway;
    SINGLE FILE METHOD;
        mkdir /lib/firmware/qcom/venus-5.2
        cp qcvss850.mbn /lib/firmware/qcom/venus-5.2/venus.mdt
    SPLIT FILE METHOD;
        mkdir /lib/firmware/qcom/venus-5.2
        python2 pil-splitter.py qcvss850.mbn venus       
        cp venus* /lib/firmware/qcom/venus-5.2/
   
    Now their are sum .jsn files that i dont know what are used for but well grabem in case
        git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git
        sudo cp linux-firmware/qcom/sdm845/*.jsn /lib/firmware/qcom/LENOVO/81JL/
    BLUETOOTH firmwares are in linux-firmware/qca/*
    Now we want to add the required firmware files to the initrd but celliwig has saved the day with initramfs-tools hook that does this for us
        wget https://github.com/Celliwig/Lenovo-Yoga-c630-packages/raw/master/initramfs-tools-firmware/initramfs-tools-firmware_0.1_all.deb
        sudo dpkg -i initramfs-tools-firmware_0.1_all.deb
        sudo update-initramfs -k $(uname -r) -c
    If installed on older kernel update /etc/initramfs-tools/firmware to look like this;
qcom/LENOVO/81JL/qcdsp1v2850.mbn
qcom/LENOVO/81JL/qcdsp2850.mbn
qcom/LENOVO/81JL/qccdsp850.mbn
qcom/LENOVO/81JL/qcadsp850.mbn

INSTALLING KERNEL!!!!
    The default hooks that deal with the .dts files are wrong. We have two options 1 patch the script for the c630 or manually make a 
    dirctory and copying/renaming the dtb before every kernel install.
    OPTION 1 PATCH;  # everything works automagically, the patch is in this kernels C630 folder its called functions.patch
        cd /usr/share/flash-kernel
        sudo patch -p1 < /path-to-patch/functions.patch
    OPTION 2 MANUAL; in this example we are installing linux-image-5.7.0-rc1_5.7.0-rc1-1_arm64.deb and we have sdm850-lenovo-yoga-c630.dtb
    sudo mkdir /usr/lib/linux-image-5.7.0-rc1
    sudo cp sdm850-lenovo-yoga-c630.dtb /usr/lib/linux-image-5.7.0-rc1/laptop-lenovo-yoga-c630.dtb
    sudo dpkg -i linux-image-5.7.0-rc1_5.7.0-rc1-1_arm64.deb
    
GRUB the bootloader requires a couple of options pd_ignore_unused clk_ignore_unused efi=novamap
        sudo pluma /etc/default/grub
    change line starting with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=  to
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="efi=novamap pd_ignore_unused clk_ignore_unused"
        sudo update-grub

Audio;
    get the ucm2 files from;
        https://git.linaro.org/people/srinivas.kandagatla/alsa-ucm-conf.git
        or this kernels C630 folder
    copy ucm2 files
        sudo cp alsa-ucm-conf/ucm2/codecs/w* /usr/share/alsa/ucm2/codecs/
        sudo cp -R alsa-ucm-conf/ucm2/Lenovo-YOGA-C630-13Q50 /usr/share/alsa/ucm2/
    diff models require diff folder names
        sudo cp -R /usr/share/alsa/ucm2/Lenovo-YOGA-C630-13Q50 /usr/share/alsa/ucm2/Lenovo-YOGA-C63
        sudo cp /usr/share/alsa/ucm2/Lenovo-YOGA-C630-13Q50/Lenovo-YOGA-C630-13Q50.conf /usr/share/alsa/ucm2/Lenovo-YOGA-C63/Lenovo-YOGA-C63.conf
    POSSIBLE ISSUES; My machine lists the sound card as disabled with dummy output on cold boot, everytime i shutdown in panics reboots *FIXED, on reboot sound card comes
    up and can be used after switching to headphones out then move volume bar then select speakers. To have sound on cold boot, first get sound working
    then switch output to headphones.
        sudo alsactl store
        sudo chmod +s /var/lib/alsa/alsa.state
    Now cold boot should present enabled soundcard just switch to headphones change volume and switch back to speakers
    OLDER UCM INSTALLS; use the old ucm files from here; #or this kernels C630 folder
        git clone https://github.com/andersson/alsa-lib.git
        sudo cp -R alsa-lib/src/conf/ucm/LENOVO-81JL-LenovoYOGAC630_13Q50-LNVNB161216 /usr/share/alsa/ucm/
        sudo cp -R /usr/share/alsa/ucm/LENOVO-81JL-LenovoYOGAC630_13Q50-LNVNB161216 /usr/share/alsa/ucm2/Lenovo-YOGA-C63
        sudo cp /usr/share/alsa/ucm2/Lenovo-YOGA-C63/LENOVO-81JL-LenovoYOGAC630_13Q50-LNVNB161216.conf /usr/share/alsa/ucm2/Lenovo-YOGA-C63/Lenovo-YOGA-C63.conf
        sudo cp -R /usr/share/alsa/ucm/LENOVO-81JL-LenovoYOGAC630_13Q50-LNVNB161216 /usr/share/alsa/ucm2/Lenovo-YOGA-C630-13Q50
        sudo cp /usr/share/alsa/ucm2/Lenovo-YOGA-C63/LENOVO-81JL-LenovoYOGAC630_13Q50-LNVNB161216.conf /usr/share/alsa/ucm2/Lenovo-YOGA-C630-13Q50/Lenovo-YOGA-C630-13Q50.conf
    FIXES;
    linux 5.5.0 with ucm (not ucm2) files the audio was messed up for first 30 seconds of play and pops could be heard after, non of these issues on newer alsa ucm2 and
    kernel 5.7.0 PULSEAUDIO its possible on older ucm install the issues could have been helped with the tsched option for pulseaudio
        sed -i "s|^load-module module-udev-detect|load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0|" ${D}${sysconfdir}/pulse/default.pa
    automate the switching of speakers/headphons volume fix/hack, scripts found in C630/usr/local/bin/sound-fix.sh 
        sudo cp C630/usr/local/bin/sound-fix.sh /usr/local/bin/sound-fix.sh
        sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sound-fix.sh
    then add to your window manager autostart. if issues i suggest playing with the sleep variables placement/timing
    or removing them entirely and have /etc/xdg/autostart/pulseaudio.desktop run the script.
    I also included my alsa.state files for both headphones (required) and speakers in C630 folder
    
Wifi;
    Altho missing from linaro's directions i believe a directory called /readwrite is required along with /readonly/firmware/images
    the wlanmdsp.mbn from newer linux-firmware package is better more stable then one on windows partition
    USELESS     if u get chan info event msgs this can supposedly fix that;
    USELESS     git clone https://github.com/qca/qca-swiss-army-knife.git
    USELESS     ./qca-swiss-army-knife/tools/scripts/ath10k/ath10k-fwencoder --modify --features=wowlan,mgmt-tx-by-reference,non-bmi,single-chan-info-per-channel  firmware-5.bin
    SAME OPTIONS THE FIRMWARE ALREADY HAS ENABLED
    POSSIBLE ISSUES; If your upgrading to kernel >=5.6 qrtr-ns service has been moved to the kernel but the lib from the service is still needed. The current version of qrt-ns looks at kernel version       disables itself if >=5.6, so if upgrading , upgrade qrtr-ns from https://github.com/andersson/qrtr
  
  
GPU
    Needs shaders which the celliwig app doesnt get. 
        wget http://releases.linaro.org/96boards/dragonboard845c/qualcomm/firmware/RB3_firmware_20190529180356-v4.zip
        unp RB3_firmware_20190529180356-v4.zip
        sudo cp $(find ./RB3_firmware_20190529180356-v4 -name a630_sqe.fw) /lib/firmware/qcom/
        sudo cp $(find ./RB3_firmware_20190529180356-v4 -name a630_gmu.fw) /lib/firmware/qcom/
        sudo mount /dev/sda4 /mnt
        sudo find /mnt -name qcdxkmsuc850.mbn  (it may find multiple ls -la them and use the newest)
        sudo cp {path to qcdxkmsuc850.mbn /lib/firmware/qcom/
    POSSIBLE ISSUES; the mesa packages had a bug where screens wouldnt redraw correctly especially text IE terminal-emulator, issue is fixed in master/20.1 but if using
    older mesa's then apply these patches depending on version
    19.3 https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/5192
    20.0 https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/5190
    20.1 https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/5190  
UPGRADING MESA;
    linaro keeps semi regular updated source packages with debian package support
        git clone https://git.linaro.org/landing-teams/working/qualcomm/pkg/mesa.git
        cd mesa
        sudo apt-get build-dep mesa
        sudo dpkg-buildpackage -b
    

VENUS DECODERS/ENCODERS 
find qcvss850.mbn on windows partition use pil_splitter.py 
to split it into files then cp to firmware directory
errors on init caint reset


GPS
    the gps in on remoteproc so we need the pds protocol luckily linaro added this to gpsd
        git clone https://git.linaro.org/landing-teams/working/qualcomm/pkg/gpsd.git
        sudo apt-get build-dep gpsd
        sudo dpkg-buildpackage -b
    then install the libgps and gpsd debs then well disable the service and do things manually
        sudo systemctl disable gpsd.service
            open terminal
        sudo gpsd -N -D9 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock
            open another terminal
        sudo gpsdctl add pds://any
        sudo xgps
    POSSIBLE ISSUES, may hafta repeat the process of starting/configuring gpsd a couple of times especially if in area with low gps signal.

MODEM
    edit dts file (already in this kernel) and add the firmware
    find/download ipa_fws.elf from windows partition. use pil_splitter.py to split into files with prefix ipa_fws copy to firmware directory.
    it now shows in dmesg that the modem is booted. I cannot test further because i believe if i had an active sim once the modem connected
    to a tower and had data i would get a rmnet device that i could use ip to setup. something similiar to;
        ip link add link wwp0s20u5i2 name rmnet0 type rmnet mux_id 1
    and use something like qmicli or modemmanager to get it going? 

FIXES;
    SHUTDOWN;
        the system will crash on shutdown if connected to wireless AP add this service which disconnects wifi at start of shutdown, this kernels
        source directory 
            sudo cp C630/etc/systemd/system/iw-disconnect.service /etc/systemd/system/iw-disconnect.service 
            sudo systemctl enable iw-disconnect.service 
        The system will crash on shutdown if firefox is running when starting shutdown, simply close firefox.
    USB;
        sum devices that use too little power will not enumerate, my hack is to add a resistor if possible, or use a usb vol/amp meter in-line. 
    GTK SLOW WINDOW CREATION;
        The headphone/speakers fix script didnt catch do it manually and they will open fine. No idea the connection.
    LOOSE ABILITY TO RUN su OR sudo (just stalls/sits)
        shutdown with systemctl it doesnt need privlidges
            systemctl poweroff
