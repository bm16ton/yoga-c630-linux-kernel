<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>
This document uses the convention X.Y.Z for the release number with X.Y being
the stable branch name.
</p>

<p>
Mesa provides feature and bugfix releases. Former use zero as patch version (Z),
while the latter have a non-zero one.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>
<pre>
Mesa 10.1.0 - 10.1 branch, feature
Mesa 10.1.4 - 10.1 branch, bugfix
Mesa 12.0.0 - 12.0 branch, feature
Mesa 12.0.2 - 12.0 branch, bugfix
</pre>


<h2 id="schedule">Release schedule</h2>

<p>
Releases should happen on Wednesdays. Delays can occur although those
should be kept to a minimum.
</p>

<p>
See our <a href="release-calendar.html" target="_parent">calendar</a>
for information about how the release schedule is planned, and the
date and other details for individual releases.
</p>

<h2>Feature releases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Available approximately every three months.</li>
<li>Initial timeplan available 2-4 weeks before the planned branchpoint (rc1)
on the mesa-announce@ mailing list.</li>
<li>Typically, the final release will happen after 4
candidates. Additional ones may be needed in order to resolve blocking
regressions, though.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stable releases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Normally available once every two weeks.</li>
<li>Only the latest branch has releases. See note below.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note: There is one or two releases overlap when changing branches. For example:
</p>

<p>
The final release from the 12.0 series Mesa 12.0.5 will be out around the same
time (or shortly after) 13.0.1 is out.
</p>

<p>
This also involves that, as a final release may be delayed due to the
need of additional candidates to solve some blocking regression(s),
the release manager might have to update
the <a href="release-calendar.html" target="_parent">calendar</a> with
additional bug fix releases of the current stable branch.
</p>


<h2 id="pickntest">Cherry-picking and testing</h2>

<p>
Commits nominated for the active branch are picked as based on the
<a href="submittingpatches.html#criteria" target="_parent">criteria</a> as
described in the same section.
</p>

<p>
Nominations happen via special tags in the commit messages, and via gitlab
merge requests against the staging branches. There are special scripts used
to read the tags.
</p>

<p>
The maintainer should watch or be in contact with the Intel CI team, as well
as watch the gitlab CI for regressions.
</p>

<p>
Cherry picking should be done with the '-x' switch (to automatically add
"cherry picked from ..." to the commit message):
</p>

<code>
git cherry-pick -x abcdef12345667890
</code>

<p>
Developers can request, <em>as an exception</em>, patches to be applied up-to
the last one hour before the actual release. This is made <strong>only</strong>
with explicit permission/request, and the patch <strong>must</strong> be very
well contained. Thus it cannot affect more than one driver/subsystem.
</p>

<p>Following developers have requested permanent exception</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ilia Mirkin</em></li>
<li><em>AMD team</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The gitlab CI must pass.</p>

<p>
For Windows related changes, the main contact point is Brian
Paul. Jose Fonseca can also help as a fallback contact.
</p>

<p>
For Android related changes, the main contact is Tapani
P&auml;lli. Mauro Rossi is collaborating with android-x86 and may
provide feedback about the build status in that project.
</p>

<p>
For MacOSX related changes, Jeremy Huddleston Sequoia is currently a
good contact point.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> If a patch in the current queue needs any additional
fix(es), then they should be squashed together. The commit messages and the
&quot;<code>cherry picked from</code>&quot;-tags must be preserved.
</p>

<h2>Regression/functionality testing</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>no regressions should be observed for Piglit/dEQP/CTS/Vulkan on Intel platforms</em></li>
<li><em>no regressions should be observed for Piglit using the swrast, softpipe
and llvmpipe drivers</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stagingbranch">Staging branch</h2>

<p>
A live branch, which contains the currently merge/rejected patches is available
in the main repository under <code>staging/X.Y</code>. For example:
</p>
<pre>
staging/18.1 - WIP branch for the 18.1 series
staging/18.2 - WIP branch for the 18.2 series
</pre>

<p>
Notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>People are encouraged to test the staging branch and report regressions.</li>
<li>The branch history is not stable and it <strong>will</strong> be rebased,</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="branch">Making a branchpoint</h2>

<p>
A branchpoint is made such that new development can continue in parallel to
stabilisation and bugfixing.
</p>

<p>
Note: Before doing a branch ensure that basic build and <code>meson test</code>
testing is done and there are little to-no issues. Ideally all of those should
be tackled already.
</p>

<p>
Check if the version number is going to remain as, alternatively
<code> git mv docs/relnotes/{current,new}.html </code> as appropriate.
</p>

<p>
To setup the branchpoint:
</p>
<pre>
git checkout master # make sure we're in master first
git tag -s X.Y-branchpoint -m "Mesa X.Y branchpoint"
git checkout -b X.Y
git checkout master
$EDITOR VERSION # bump the version number
git commit -as
truncate docs/relnotes/new_features.txt
git commit -a
git push origin X.Y-branchpoint X.Y
</pre>

<p>
Now go to
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/milestones" target="_parent">gitlab</a> and add the new Mesa version X.Y.
</p>

<p>
Check that there are no distribution breaking changes and revert them if needed.
For example: files being overwritten on install, etc. Happens extremely rarely -
we had only one case so far (see commit 2ced8eb136528914e1bf4e000dea06a9d53c7e04).
</p>

<h2 id="release">Making a new release</h2>

<p>
These are the instructions for making a new Mesa release.
</p>

<h3>Get latest source files</h3>

<p>
Ensure the latest code is available - both in your local master and the
relevant branch.
</p>

<h3 id="basictesting">Perform basic testing</h3>

<p>
Most of the testing should already be done during the
<a href="#pickntest">cherry-pick</a>
So we do a quick 'touch test'
</p>

<ul>
<li>meson dist</li>
<li>scons (from release tarball)</li>
<li>the produced binaries work</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Here is one solution:
</p>

<pre>
__glxgears_cmd='glxgears 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -v "configuration file"'
__es2info_cmd='es2_info 2&gt;&amp;1 | egrep "GL_VERSION|GL_RENDERER|.*dri\.so"'
__es2gears_cmd='es2gears_x11 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -v "configuration file"'
test "x$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" != 'x' &amp;&amp; __old_ld="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/test/usr/local/lib/:"${__old_ld}"
export LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH=`pwd`/test/usr/local/lib/dri/
export LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose
eval $__glxinfo_cmd
eval $__glxgears_cmd
eval $__es2info_cmd
eval $__es2gears_cmd
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=true
eval $__glxinfo_cmd
eval $__glxgears_cmd
eval $__es2info_cmd
eval $__es2gears_cmd
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=true
export GALLIUM_DRIVER=softpipe
eval $__glxinfo_cmd
eval $__glxgears_cmd
eval $__es2info_cmd
eval $__es2gears_cmd
# Smoke test DOTA2
unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
test "x$__old_ld" != 'x' &amp;&amp; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$__old_ld" &amp;&amp; unset __old_ld
unset LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH
unset LIBGL_DEBUG
unset LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE
unset GALLIUM_DRIVER
export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=`pwd`/test/usr/local/share/vulkan/icd.d/intel_icd.x86_64.json
steam steam://rungameid/570  -vconsole -vulkan
unset VK_ICD_FILENAMES
</pre>

<h3>Create release notes for the new release</h3>

<p>
The release notes are completely generated by the
<code>bin/gen_release_notes.py</code> script. Simply run this script before
bumping the version, and commit the results.

The only thing left to do is add the sha256 sums.
</p>

<p>
Increment the version contained in the file VERSION at Mesa's top-level, then
commit this change.
</p>

<p>
Commit these changes and push the branch.
</p>

<pre>
git push origin HEAD
</pre>


<h3>Use the release.sh script from xorg <a href="https://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/util/modular/">util-modular</a></h3>

<p>
Start the release process.
</p>

<pre>
../relative/path/to/release.sh . # append --dist if you've already done distcheck above
</pre>

<p>
Pay close attention to the prompts as you might be required to enter your GPG
and SSH passphrase(s) to sign and upload the files, respectively.
</p>

<h3>Add the sha256sums to the release notes</h3>

<p>
Edit docs/relnotes/X.Y.Z.html to add the sha256sum as available in the mesa-X.Y.Z.announce template. Commit this change.
</p>

<h3>Back on mesa master, add the new release notes into the tree</h3>

<p>
Something like the following steps will do the trick:
</p>

<pre>
git cherry-pick -x X.Y~1
git cherry-pick -x X.Y
</pre>

<p>Then run the <pre>./bin/post_version.py X.Y.Z</pre>, where X.Y.Z is the
version you just made. This will updated docs/relnotes.html,
docs/index.html, and docs/release-calendar.html. It will then generate
a git commit automatically. Check that everything looks correct and push:
</p>

<pre>
	git push origin master X.Y
</pre>


<h2 id="announce">Announce the release</h2>

<p>
Use the generated template during the releasing process.
</p>

<p>
Again, pay attention to add a note to warn about a final release in a
series, if that is the case.
</p>


<h2 id="gitlab">Update gitlab issues</h2>

<p>
Parse through the bug reports as listed in the docs/relnotes/X.Y.Z.html
document. If there's outstanding action, close the bug referencing the commit
ID which addresses the bug and mention the Mesa version that has the fix.
</p>

<p>
Note: the above is not applicable to all the reports, so use common sense.
