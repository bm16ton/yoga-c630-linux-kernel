# A string beginning with 0x is interpreted as a sequence of paired hex bytes,
# leading 0x not included.
#
# Comment lines led with "#%" are vendor section marks to be used when
# generating an HTML table from this file.  Each should consist of a vendor

#
# Further notes:
# * In the packaging feld, a "GPS mouse" is a standalone sensor in a
#   display-less case designed be used as an outbard peripheral.  An
#   "OEM module" is an un-cased circuit board with edge connectors; a
#   "chipset" is what it sounds like.
#   A "handset" is a standalone GPS with a display and human-usable
#   controls. A "handsfree" is a hands-free unit with display designed for
#   mounting on a car windshield or boat dash.
# * In the rating field:
#    "excellent" - gpsd recognizes the GPS rapidly and reliably,
#		  reports are complete and correct.
#    "good" -- gpsd has minor problems or lag recognizing the device,
#	      but reports are complete and correct.
#    "fair" -- Reports have minor dropouts or problems, including occasional
#	      transient nonsense values.
#    "poor" -- Reports frequently have values that are wrong or nonsense.
#    "broken" -- gpsd frequently fails to recognize the device at all.
#    "other -- See Technical Notes.

notes = The bu* logs are in native binary format; the Haicom, Holux, Pharos,
      and TripNav logs in NMEA. NMEA starts with GGA and ends with RMC. The
      tn204 NMEA looks remarkably like older Garmin cruft and may be emulating
      one, including the split reporting cycle.

      Resets to 4800N1 every time it is unplugged. Has a tendency to freeze
      when switched from binary to NMEA mode (unplugging it fixes this).

type = engine
description = Version 5 of the SiRF (Sirfstar V) GPS engine
engine = SiRF-5
nmea = Unknown

#rating = poor
logs = beidou-bd.log, beidou-gb.log
notes = SiRF-IV variant produced for the Chinese market; it handles the
      Beidou and GLONASS constellations as well as US GPS.  The main
      variant is described by the Chinese standard "Technical
      Specification of Communication Protocol for BDS Compatible
      Positioning Module" (TSCPB) and uses the talker ID BD.  This
      standard is not available in English translation. There is a
      variant with closer NMEA 4.00 conformance that uses the talker
      ID GB.

     cm accuracy.
     Measured CEP(50) with partial sky view of 1.9m.
     RTCM/RAW mode untested with gpsd.

notes = This receiver does not support PPS timing output. Much like the
      BU-353 except for using a SiRFStar IV chip.  Has poor
      sensitivity and takes a lot longer to cold-start than the vendor
      claim 45 of 45 seconds.  Gary Miller rates this device "DO NOT
      EVER BUY ONE!", observing "The big selling point of the SiRF IV
      is the lower power needs.  Looks like they made that happen at
      the expense of sensitivity and timeliness of fixes."  Also,
      has the SiRF-IV tendency to freeze when switched from binary
      to NMEA mode (power-cycling it unjams it).

notes = This is a GPS data logger with mouse functionality. Before it can be
      used with gpsd, the mouse functionality has to be switched on. That
      can be done with the rgm3800py utility by Karsten Petersen. The author of
      said tool has been very helpful to me by describing how to do that on
      the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rgm3800py/wiki/GPSd">
      projectpage</a>. Basically, one needs to run "rgm3800.py -d
      /dev/ttyUSB0 gmouse on" before starting gpsd.

[Saab R4]
type = device

model =  SAAB AIS GPS R4 positioning system
uses = Pilot Plug
notes = This is data from the PilotPlug, AIS + NMEA from various
      instruments on a Transas bridge. This is not normal GPS
      data. Pilotplugs are RS422, 38400 8N1. This data is obtained via
      a Moxa UPort 1130 using Minicom.  GPSD does not work well with
      the UPort 1130, but the data is recognised (but not all NMEA
      sentences). This is from a simulator but with real equipment.

      too much data is thrown at it (ie. gpsd probes) thus it may

      more recent instances of gpsd break the probe writes into pieces
      interleaved with read, and may no longer trigger this problem)
