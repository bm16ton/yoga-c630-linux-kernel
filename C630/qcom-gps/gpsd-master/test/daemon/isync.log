# Name: iSync
# Description: Spectratime iSync GPS-disciplined rubidium oscillator
# Submitter: Michael Brown <mbrown@fensystems.co.uk>
# Date: 2016-02-03
# Location: Chicago, IL, USA
#
# Notes: Manipulated to include artificial packet collisions (where
#	 the iSync microcontroller injects a packet into the middle of
#	 a packet from the underlying u-Blox.  Such packets are
#	 observed in practice, albeit rarely.
