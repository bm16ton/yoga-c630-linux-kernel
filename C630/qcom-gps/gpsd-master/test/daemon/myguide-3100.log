# Name: Myguide 3100
# Vendor: Typhoon
# Chipset: Unknown
# Description: Car-dash GPS
# Submitter: Gleb Smirnoff <glebius@glebius.int.ru> 
# Date: 2011-03-23
# Notes: Contains initial segement of no fix followed by stationary fix.
#        The 3100 has been end-of-lifed but is still found in the wild.
#        No database entry for this yet, we haven'y been able to find
#        out enough about it.
#
#        The no fix segment has GPRMC with lat/lon/alt, followed by GPGSA,
#        saying no fix.  And repeated.
