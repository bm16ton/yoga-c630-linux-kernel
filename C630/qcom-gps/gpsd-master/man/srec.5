.SH "NAME"
srec \- Motorola S\-record record and file format
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Motorola S\-records are a form of simple ASCII encoding for binary data\&. This format is commonly used for firmware uploads to GPSes, industrial robots, and other kinds of microcontroller\-driven hardware\&. It has several convenient properties, including inspectability, easy editing with any text editor, and checksumming for verification of transmission across noisy serial lines\&.
.PP
An S\-record file consists of a sequence of specially formatted ASCII character strings\&. An S\-record will be less than or equal to 78 bytes in length\&.
.PP
The order of S\-records within a file is of no significance and no particular order may be assumed\&.
.PP
The general format of an S\-record follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-//\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-//\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+
| type | count | address  |            data           | checksum |
+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-//\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-//\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
type
.RS 4
A char[2] field\&. These characters describe the type of record (S0, S1, S2, S3, S5, S7, S8, or S9)\&.
.RE
.PP
count
.RS 4
A char[2] field\&. These characters when paired and interpreted as a big\-endian hexadecimal integer, display the count of remaining character pairs in the record\&.
.RE
.PP
address
.RS 4
A char[4,6, or 8] field\&. These characters grouped and interpreted as a big\-endian hexadecimal integer, display the address at which the data field is to be loaded into memory\&. The length of the field depends on the number of bytes necessary to hold the address\&. A 2\-byte address uses 4 characters, a 3\-byte address uses 6 characters, and a 4\-byte address uses 8 characters\&.
.RE
.PP
data
.RS 4
A char [0\-64] field\&. These characters when paired and interpreted as hexadecimal values represent the memory loadable data or descriptive information\&.
.RE
.PP
checksum
.RS 4
A char[2] field\&. These characters when paired and interpreted as a big\-endian hexadecimal integer display the least significant byte of the ones complement of the sum of the byte values represented by the pairs of characters making up the count, the address, and the data fields\&.
.RE
.PP
Each record is terminated with a line feed\&. If any additional or different record terminator(s) or delay characters are needed during transmission to the target system it is the responsibility of the transmitting program to provide them\&.
.PP
There are 9 record types, as follows:
.PP
S0
.RS 4
The type of record is \*(AqS0\*(Aq (0x5330)\&. The address field is unused and will be filled with zeros (0x0000)\&. The header information within the data field is divided into the following subfields\&.

If you write code to convert S\-Records, you should always assume that a record can be as long as 514 (decimal) characters in length (255 * 2 = 510, plus 4 characters for the type and count fields), plus any terminating character(s)\&. That is, in establishing an input buffer in C, you would declare it to be an array of 515 chars, thus leaving room for the terminating null character\&.
