# GPSes don't have their own USB device class.  They're serial-over-USB
# devices, so what you see is actually the ID of the serial-over-USB chip.
# Fortunately, just two of these account for over 80% of consumer-grade
# GPS sensors.  The gpsdplug script will tell a running gpsd that it should
# look at the device that just went active, because it might be a GPS.
