The repo directory contains git configuration files and hooks as
used at Berlios. Here follows a short description of the files and
what they do:

description: Description of the project as displayed by gitweb/cgit.

config: Repository configuration, including config details for the
        hooks.

hooks/post-receive: This script is run after receive-pack has accepted a
                    pack and the repository has been updated.
                    Currently passes stdin to post-receive-email.sh
                    which mails out commit messages to the commit
                    mailing list. See the head of post-receive-email.sh
                    for a documentation of the config options for the
                    hook.

hooks/post-receive-email.sh: see hooks/post-receive

hooks/post-update: Runs after the update hook. Executes
                   git update-server-info
                   to update the auxiliary info file to help dumb
                   servers (needed to clone via http)

hooks/update-custom: Append to the standard update hook script.  Calls
                     ciabot.py, which you must also install.

The executable script "upload" can be used to update the repo copies with
files from this directory.  Give it arguments to upload specified filenames,
for example

    upload config

uploads the config file. With no arguments, uploads config and all hook scripts
under hooks/ directory.
