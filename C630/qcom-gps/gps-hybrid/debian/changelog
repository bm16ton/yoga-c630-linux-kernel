  * [0a8e4e18] Pull json fixes from upstream to fix a stack-based

    CVE-2018-17937 / Closes: #925327
    The update also fixes several other json parser bugs.
    - ECMA-404 says JSON \u must have 4 hex digits
    - Allow for \u escapes with fewer than 4 digits.
    - Fail on bad escape string.

  * [528213ef] Update regression tests according to the leap second change.
    Whenever the default leap second changes in timebase.h the
    GPS tests will break (times one second off) and the testloads will
    have to be rebuilt.  The problem is in the SiRF tests; that driver
    relies on the default until it gets the current offset from subframe
    data.
    timebase.h is being created from the leapseconds.cache file at build
    time. As leapseconds happen rarely, there is no support to read them
    from a config file included yet.

    Steinar H. Gunderson (Closes: #410133, #410138, #410132).

    - Updating the manpage category of gpsd, thanks to Thijs Kinkhorst for the
      hint.

gpsd (2.34.dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Hijacking the package as announced on debian-devel@lists.d.o
    in <470DEE3C.80603@bzed.de> due to the old maintainer being MIA.
  * New upstream version
  * Removing Tachometer.c due to an unclear licensing, this introduces
    .dfsg to the version number and results in not being able to build
    xgpsspeed.
  * Building new packages:
    - python-gps containing the python modules, this also fixes a bug
      complaining about missing python-support (Closes: #413925)
    - Splitting libgps and the according devel files in separate packages
      (Closes: #295375)
  * Installing gpsd in /usr/sbin again. gpsd is a system daemon and only
    rarely used as user command. 
  * Auto discovery of USB GPS devices is disabled by default now, as the USB
    devices use nothing but a standard usb to serial converter. This resulted
    in trouble if you wanted to use a normal serial converter without attached
    GPS device. A rules file is provided as example now.
    (Closes: #442467, #404780)
  * debian/compat:
    - Bumping to level 5

      startet at bootup, thanks to Kiro Zimmer (Closes: #395297).
    - Reflecting the change in gpsd's location.
  * debian/gpsd.templates:
    - Replacing the question for gpsd/device by a title, fixing a lintian
      warning
  * debian/gpsd.{postrm,preinst}:
    - Remove existing diversions of gpsd while upgrading.
      Thanks to Andreas Putzo (Closes: #446780).
  * debian/patches:
    - General cleanup, removing obsolete patches, adding several new patches
      to suit the new version and packaging.
  * debian/po:
    - Adding several new translations, thanks to
      * cobaco (aka Bart Cornelis) - Dutch translation (Closes: #415519)
      * Rudy Godoy Guillén - Spanish translation (Closes: #426172)
      * Kenshi Muto - Japanese translation (Closes: #412507)
  * debian/rules:
    - Rewriting file completely. This also introduces new files to the
      packaging (debian/{gpsd,gpsd-clients}.install, debian/gpsd.examples)
      and removes several unused/obsolete files:
      (debian/{remove_rpath.sh,gpsd-clients.docs}, debian/*.dirs,
       debian/gpsd.lintian-overrides).
  * debian/watch, debian/dfsg-clean.sh:
    - Adding files to watch for upstream versions and handle the removal of
      non-free material automatically.
