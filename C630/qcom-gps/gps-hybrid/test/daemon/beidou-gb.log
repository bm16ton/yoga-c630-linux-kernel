# Name: AtlasVI/PrimaII for SiRF-TriG with NMEA 4.00 conformance patch
# Chipset = SiRF-Trig
# Date = 2015-03-02
# Submitter = Eli Huang <eli.huang.cn@gmail.com>
# Notes: Contains Beidou and GLONASS sentences; Beidou sentences have the
#	alternate GB talker ID rather than the BD mandated in the TSCPB 
#	standard. Use this log to test that Beidou NMEA IDs with GB
#	are being mapped to the Beidou PRN range and that Beidou GSV
#	sentences with GB are properly integrated into a combined skyview.
