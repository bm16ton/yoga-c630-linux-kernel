# Name: ET-322 engine board from GlobalSat
# Chipset: SiRF-III
# Submitter: Val Schmidt <vschmidt@ccom.unh.edu>
# Date: 2010-04-25
# Location: Newark, DE
# Transport: UDP
#
# The board lives inside a Gavia AUV <http://www.gavia.is/>, which was
# placed in the parking log of a university laboratory for the capture
# of this data. It was completely stationary. Also, this sample
# contains strings that indicate the date. 
#
# The contents of the Transport header tell the gpsd test framework to
# ship the file to the subordinate gpsd via IP datagrams.  The source
