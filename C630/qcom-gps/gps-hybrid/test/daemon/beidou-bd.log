# Name: AtlasVI/PrimaII for SiRF-TriG
# Chipset = SiRF-TriG
# Date = 2015-02-25
# Submitter = Eli Huang <eli.huang.cn@gmail.com>
# Notes: Contains Beidou and GLONASS sentences. The Beidou sentences use the 
#	BD talker ID, which is mandated by the Chinese standard "Technical
#	Specification of Communication Protocol for BDS Compatible Positioning
#	Module" (TSCPB).  This standard is not available in English translation.
#	Use this log to test that Beidou NMEA IDs are being mapped to
#	the Beidou PRN range and that Beidou GSV sentences are
#	properly integrated into a combined skyview.
