#     The sample was taken with the unit stationary on windowsill.
#     The log starts before the unit was powered on. The log ends
#     when I walked it about 3 meters from the bluetooth hub is was paired	
#     with.

#     (Duplicative leading and trailing sections were later removed 
#     to speed up testiing.)
