<h1>Open User-Visible Problems</h1>

<h2 id="osx-pl2303">Unknown osx-pl2303 driver issues on Mac OS X</h2>

<p>The osx-pl2303 driver appears not to work, at least under 10.9.
  Specifically, the combination of gpsd, OS X, osx-pl2303, and a
  GR601-W usually fails.  With the official Prolific drivers, this
  receiver works reliably.  The source code of this driver no longer
  appears to be available.  While the facts so far do not prove that
  the bug is in the osx-pl2303 driver, the evidence points that way,
  and no one has dug in enough to figure out what's wrong. Therefore
  we recommend against using the osx-pl2303 driver and consider it
  unsupported</p>

<p>Previously, there were problems with the osx-pl2303 driver that
  caused select not to return even when input was available.  It is
  not clear if the above issue is the same or not.</p>

<h2 id="tiocmwait">PPS fails: ioctl(TIOCMIWAIT) hangs after tcsetattr()</h2>

<p>Due to a kernel bug in some versions of Linux 2.6 (recent as of
2011 - the bug was <a
href="http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-kernel/2010/11/13/4645043">referenced
in 2010</a>) the tcsetattr() used in our autobauding hunt loop
prevents any thread(s) currently suspended in ioctl(TIOCMIWAIT) for
the same device from ever resuming. This interferes with PPS support</p>

<p>This bug has apparently persisted in some 3.x kernels.</p>

<p>The workaround is to use stty to pre-set the serial port to the right
baud rate so tcsetattr is never called.</p>

<h2 id="pps-gpio">The pps-gpio only reports on one edge</h2>

<p>The pps-gpio driver only looks at the clear edge to determine the
time of the PPS pulse.  Many GPS use the other edge, so the reported
time may be offset by the PPS pulse width.</p>

<p>Problem is present in Linux 3.19 and earlier.  The module authors
have been notified</p>

<h2 id="bluetooth">Firmware problems in some Bluetooth and USB devices can hang them</h2>

<p>The baudrate-hunting code in <code>gpsd</code> tickles a serious
firmware bug on some some Bluetooth devices; these are flagged on our
<a href="hardware.html">Hardware</a> page.  This bug may render these
GPSes catatonic.  The problem seems to be that buggy firmware inside
these receivers doesn't necessarily keep the Bluetooth serial-port
emulation and the GPS chip talking at the same baud rate. This problem
is not unique to <code>gpsd</code> &mdash; Windows users are warned
against using SiRFdemo's "Synchronize Protocol/Baud Rate" option on
Bluetooth devices.</p>

<p>If this happens, you can sometimes recover by repeatedly sending
reset messages using <code>gpsctl</code>. Otherwise, power-cycling the
GPS The only guaranteed fix is to drain the battery backing up the
GPS's settings; in extreme cases, you may have to open the case and
unsolder the backup battery so the chip forgets its configuration
settings.</p>

<p>To check whether you have this bug:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Reset your GPS to a usable state.</p></li>

<li><p>Launch gpsd with the Bluetooth device on the command line and
the -b option to prevent autobauding.</p></li>

<li><p>Observe it operating.</p></li>

<li><p>Power down the device and terminate gpsd.</p></li>

<li><p>Launch with -b again and see if it still works.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you find the device comes up on the last step, then you know
that -b is an effective workaround and can finger bad Bluetooth
firmware as the cause of the problem.</p>

<p>A separate bug with less severe symptoms afflicts some USB devices.
The probe strings <code>gpsd</code> sends in order to determine device
type and subtype may be more than a device can handle, causing it to
hang; power-cycling should fix this.  Newer versions of <code>gpsd</code>
break up the probe writes into smaller pieces, interleaving them with
the first few packet reads, so they are far less likely to trigger
this bug.</p>

<p>You can use the -b option of gpsd to prevent it from trying to
reconfigure your GPS; this will avoid both problems.</p>

<h2 id="pl2303">Linux pl2303 driver on openwrt 2.4 kernel can hang when device is read at unexpected speed</h2>

<p>Michael R. Davis reports "If you read from the device at the wrong
rate (e.g. cat /dev/xxx) it will lock up.  On openwrt it required a
hard reboot." Details <a
href='http://marc.info/?l=gpsd-dev&amp;m=115940539029940&amp;w=2'>here</a>. This
bug was reported in 2006 with an old kernel version and may since have
been fixed.</p>

<h2 id="pthread_create">pthread_create() fails to return when called in background</h2>

There is a call to pthread create in libgpsd_core.c::link_activate():

<pre><code>
    /*@i1@*/(void)pthread_create(&amp;pt,NULL,gpsd_ppsmonitor,(void *)session);
</code></pre>

<p>If this is called when gpsd is in the foreground then the thread is
created fine and pthread_create() returns right away.  If this is
called when gpsd is in the background then the thread is created fine,
but it may return!  That freezes the main loop of gpsd. There is a <a
href="http://marc.info/?l=gpsd-dev&amp;m=120124952704634&amp;w=2">workaround</a>,
but the nature of the workaround only makes their bug more
mysterious.</p>

<h2 id="shm_damage">NTPSHM clobbers altitude under 2.4 Linux</h2>

<p>We've had one report (in march 2009) of the NTPSHM feature
clobbering altitude reports, on a Technologic TS-5500 board running a
customized 2.4.34 kernel using a <code>gpsd</code> built with GCC 2.95.3.
When NTPSHM was disabled, altitude was reported correctly.</p>

<p>Shared memory was bug-plagued on older Linux kernels; one notorious
symptom of this was that the emulation of System V IPC worked poorly,
and we suspect our corruption bug is another symptom.  No such
misbehavior has been reported from our NTPSHM-using developers under
2.6.  It is also possible that this is due to some obscure bug in GCC
or elsewhere in Technologic's cross-development toolchain.</p>

<h2 id="udev">Linux kernel doesn't generate udev close events</h2>

<p>One user has reported that the GPSD hotplug wrapper is not being
invoked on unplug of a USB receiver, because the kernel never actually
generates a remove event when closing an open serial device.
Apparently this is a <a
href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/udev-not-called-to-remove-open-usb-serial-device-585603/">well-known
bug</a> that will <a href="http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0907.2/01845.html">not be easily fixed</a>.</p>

<h1>Open Toolchain Bugs</h1>

<p><code>gpsd</code> is distressingly good at tickling bugs in
development toolchains.  Most of these, thankfully, are non-issues
if you keep your toolchain up to date.</p>

<h2 id="pyinstall">Defective Python installation in SuSE 10.3rc</h2>

<p>The Python 2.5 installed with SuSE 10.3rc is missing a needed
Makefile.  This prevents the <code>gpsd</code> Python components from
building correctly.</p>

<h2 id="gcc421">Compiler optimizer bugs can produce error-modeling errors</h2>

<p>The floating-point code in the daemon's error modeler (the logic
that produces uncertainty estimates in the sensor doesn't supply them)
is sensitive to optimizer bugs.  If the optimizer is flaky, different
levels of operation can cause the speed calculation to either converge
or blow up in FP operations; the effect is that when it is actually
reported seems to vary randomly with level of optimization.</p>

<p>Under GCC 4.2.1, -O2 diverges from what GCC 4.4.1 reports, causing
regression-test failures. Dropping back to -O1 or going up to -O3
restores behavior like GCC 4.4.1's.</p>

<h2 id="scons_cpp">scons doesn't honor parse_flags in a Program() using C++</h2>

<p>In building test_gpsmm, we should get libgps_dump_state() from the
client library, but scons 1.2.0 has a bug; we can't get it to add
-lgps to the link lime, apparently because it doesn't honor
parse_flags on a Program() build of a C++ .cpp file.</p>

<h2 id="mfence">Illegal-instruction errors near fence operations</h2>

<p>The shared-memory export relies on being able to generate some
fence instructions that are processor-specfic.  We have a report that
under Ubuntu 10.04 running on a 32-bit Athlon processor the daemon
dies with an illegal instruction error when attempting the fence
operation.</p>

<p>To work around this, disable the shared-memory export by building
with "scons shm_export=no".</p>

<h2 id="#netbsd-curses">gpsmon won't build with the curses library on NetBSD 6</h2>

<p>The base NetBSD install (netBSD 6, anyway) includes curses, but
it's an old version that lacks the "syncok" function used by gpsmon. A
simple '-lcurses' is sufficient to make cgps work, but not gpsmon.</p>

<p>It's possible to install a reasonably current ncurses on NetBSD as
a package, but the package setup doesn't include pkg-config data, so
the ability to use it doesn't get discovered automatically.</p>

<p>It's possible to check the existence of the package with the
NetBSD-specific "pkg_info -E", and then fake the options that one
would expect to be supplied by pkg-config, but the resulting setup
still doesn't build, for an as-yet-undetermined reason.</p>

<h1>Fixed Problems</h1>

<p>We document these here in case you're running on an older system.
They will be removed as they become sufficiently ancient.</p>

<h2 id="startup">Distro-dependent problems with gpsd startup</h2>

<p>See <a href='http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132288'>this
Gentoo bug</a>.  This shows up on other distributions as well, but
not under Fedora Core.  The Gentoo problem can be fixed by creating a
/var/run/usb directory; this fix may apply to other distributions as
well.</p>

<h2 id="pysocket">Python socket library barfs on IPV6 notation in the /etc/hosts file</h2>

<p>Robert J.Berger &lt;rberger@ibd.com&gt; reports:
Until I changed the line in /etc/hosts from:</p>

<pre class='code'>
::1    localhost.localdomain   localhost
</pre>

to:<br>

<pre class='code'>
127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost
</pre>

<p>gps.py would fail when trying to open the socket connection to the gpsd:</p>

<pre class='code'>
   File "/usr/local/bin/spGps.py", line 198, in __init__
     self.connect(host, port)
   File "/usr/local/bin/spGps.py", line 237, in connect
     raise socket.error, msg
socket.error: (111, 'Connection refused')
</pre>

<p>and gpsprof would fail with:</p>

<pre class='code'>
# gpsprof | gnuplot -persist
gpsprof: gpsd unreachable.
</pre>

<p>This is with Python 2.4.4 under Red Hat Linux, kernel version 2.6.18.
This was filed upstream as Python bug 1603527 on their old tracker, and
is no longer open on their new one.</p>

<h2 id="isgps">isgps.c triggers an optimizer bug in older gcc versions</h2>

<p>The isgps.c file confuses the gcc-3.4.[23] optimizer at -O2 level,
making it generate incorrect code.  Removing -O2 from the
compilation flags works around the problem.  Details are in the
isgps.c source file.</p>

<p>Compiling with --enable-max-devices=1 may trigger a gcc
optimizer bug</p>

<p>At gpsd revision level 3365, compiling with
--enable-max-devices=1 has been observed to trigger an
optimizer bug in gcc 4.1.0 20060304 (Red Hat 4.1.0-3).  The symptom is
a for-loop termination condition not causing an exit, leading to a
core dump.  Removing -O2 from the compilation flags works around the
problem; upgrading to gcc 4.1.1 20060525 (Red Hat 4.1.1-1) solves it.
Other reports indicate this bug was introduced sometime after gcc
4.0.2 20051125 (Red Hat 4.0.2-8).</p>

<h2 id="fc5_64bit">gpsd build may break on 64-bit systems running Fedora Core 5</h2>

<p>The problem may be be caused by the old ld (binutils-2.15.92.0.2-18)
being incompatible with gcc 4.1.0 on a 64-bit system. Updating to
binutils 2.16.1 or later avoids it.</p>

<h2 id="floats">Incorrect generation of floating-point code in embedded toolchains</h2>

<p>One problem area is errors in generation of floating-point code.  A
number of trouble reports have been received indicating erroneous
results on embedded platforms, most notably ARM systems. These have
all been traced back to the toolchain; when appropriate corrective
action was taken, <code>gpsd</code> functioned correctly. Source code
for a simple test program (<code>floattest.c</code>) is in the
project repository; if <code>gpsd</code> seems to be producing
incorrect output, please use this tool to validate your toolchain
before filing a bug report.</p>

<h2 id="macxlibs">Mac OS 10.5 X library packaging problem</h2>

<p>Building <code>xgpsspeed</code> will fail under MacOS 10.5.6
because the X SDK libraries and include files are not installed to the
canonical places.  This was <a
href="http://openradar.appspot.com/6498632">filed as a bug</a> with
Apple and is reported fixed.</p>
