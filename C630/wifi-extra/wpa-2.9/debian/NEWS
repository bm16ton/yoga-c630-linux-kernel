wpasupplicant (2:2.6-19) unstable; urgency=medium

  With this release, wpasupplicant no longer respects the system
  default minimum TLS version, defaulting to TLSv1.0, not TLSv1.2. If
  you're sure you will never connect to EAP networks requiring anything less
  than 1.2, add this to your wpasupplicant configuration:

    tls_disable_tlsv1_0=1
    tls_disable_tlsv1_1=1

  wpasupplicant also defaults to a security level 1, instead of the system
  default 2. Should you need to change that, change this setting in your
  wpasupplicant configuration:

    openssl_ciphers=DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=2

  Unlike wpasupplicant, hostapd still respects system defaults.

wpasupplicant (0.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The -w (wait for network interface to exist) command line option no longer
  exists. If you have scripts that require this option, it is time to change
  them, or use one of the two supported modes of operation explained at
  /usr/share/doc/wpasupplicant/README.modes.gz.

  ifupdown supports hot-plugged network devices via the "allow-hotplug" class
  of operation. An example /etc/network/interfaces configuration stanza would
  look like:

  allow-hotplug wlan0
  iface wlan0 inet dhcp
          wpa-ssid myssid
          wpa-psk mysecretpassphrase

  network-manager is also able to handle hot-plugged network devices.
