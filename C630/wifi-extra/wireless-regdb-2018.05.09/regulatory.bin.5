.SH Description
.B regulatory.bin
and
.B regulatory.db
are the files used by the Linux wireless subsystem to keep its regulatory
database information.
.PP
.B regulatory.bin
is read by
.B crda
upon the Linux kernel's request for regulatory information for a specific
ISO / IEC 3166 alpha2 country code.
.PP
.B regulatory.db
is a newer, extensible database format which (since Linux 4.15) is read
by the kernel directly as a firmware file.

The regulatory database is kept in a small binary format for size and code
efficiency. The
.B regulatory.bin
file can be parsed and read in human format by using the
.B regdbdump
command. The regulatory database files should be updated upon regulatory
changes or corrections.

.SH Upkeeping
The regulatory database is maintained by the community as such
you are encouraged to send any corrections or updates to the
linux-wireless and wireless-regdb mailing lists:
.B linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org
and
.B wireless-regdb@lists.infradead.org
