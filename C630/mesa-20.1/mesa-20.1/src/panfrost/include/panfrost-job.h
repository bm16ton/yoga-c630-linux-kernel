/*
 * Mali Attributes
 *
 * This structure lets the attribute unit compute the address of an attribute
 * given the vertex and instance ID. Unfortunately, the way this works is
 * rather complicated when instancing is enabled.
 *
 * To explain this, first we need to explain how compute and vertex threads are
 * dispatched. This is a guess (although a pretty firm guess!) since the
 * details are mostly hidden from the driver, except for attribute instancing.
 * When a quad is dispatched, it receives a single, linear index. However, we
 * need to translate that index into a (vertex id, instance id) pair, or a
 * (local id x, local id y, local id z) triple for compute shaders (although
 * vertex shaders and compute shaders are handled almost identically).
 * Focusing on vertex shaders, one option would be to do:
 *
 * vertex_id = linear_id % num_vertices
 * instance_id = linear_id / num_vertices
 *
 * but this involves a costly division and modulus by an arbitrary number.
 * Instead, we could pad num_vertices. We dispatch padded_num_vertices *
 * num_instances threads instead of num_vertices * num_instances, which results
 * in some "extra" threads with vertex_id >= num_vertices, which we have to
 * discard.  The more we pad num_vertices, the more "wasted" threads we
 * dispatch, but the division is potentially easier.
 *
 * One straightforward choice is to pad num_vertices to the next power of two,
 * which means that the division and modulus are just simple bit shifts and
 * masking. But the actual algorithm is a bit more complicated. The thread
 * dispatcher has special support for dividing by 3, 5, 7, and 9, in addition
 * to dividing by a power of two. This is possibly using the technique
 * described in patent US20170010862A1. As a result, padded_num_vertices can be
 * 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 times a power of two. This results in less wasted threads,
 * since we need less padding.
 *
 * padded_num_vertices is picked by the hardware. The driver just specifies the
 * actual number of vertices. At least for Mali G71, the first few cases are
 * given by:
 *
 * num_vertices	| padded_num_vertices
 * 3		| 4
 * 4-7		| 8
 * 8-11		| 12 (3 * 4)
 * 12-15	| 16
 * 16-19	| 20 (5 * 4)
 *
 * Note that padded_num_vertices is a multiple of four (presumably because
 * threads are dispatched in groups of 4). Also, padded_num_vertices is always
 * at least one more than num_vertices, which seems like a quirk of the
 * hardware. For larger num_vertices, the hardware uses the following
 * algorithm: using the binary representation of num_vertices, we look at the
 * most significant set bit as well as the following 3 bits. Let n be the
 * number of bits after those 4 bits. Then we set padded_num_vertices according
 * to the following table:
 *
 * high bits	| padded_num_vertices
 * 1000		| 9 * 2^n
 * 1001		| 5 * 2^(n+1)
 * 101x		| 3 * 2^(n+2)
 * 110x		| 7 * 2^(n+1)
 * 111x		| 2^(n+4)
 *
 * For example, if num_vertices = 70 is passed to glDraw(), its binary
 * representation is 1000110, so n = 3 and the high bits are 1000, and
 * therefore padded_num_vertices = 9 * 2^3 = 72.
 *
 * The attribute unit works in terms of the original linear_id. if
 * num_instances = 1, then they are the same, and everything is simple.
 * However, with instancing things get more complicated. There are four
 * possible modes, two of them we can group together:
 *
 * 1. Use the linear_id directly. Only used when there is no instancing.
 *
 * 2. Use the linear_id modulo a constant. This is used for per-vertex
 * attributes with instancing enabled by making the constant equal
 * padded_num_vertices. Because the modulus is always padded_num_vertices, this
 * mode only supports a modulus that is a power of 2 times 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.
 * The shift field specifies the power of two, while the extra_flags field
 * specifies the odd number. If shift = n and extra_flags = m, then the modulus
 * is (2m + 1) * 2^n. As an example, if num_vertices = 70, then as computed
 * above, padded_num_vertices = 9 * 2^3, so we should set extra_flags = 4 and
 * shift = 3. Note that we must exactly follow the hardware algorithm used to
 * get padded_num_vertices in order to correctly implement per-vertex
 * attributes.
 *
 * 3. Divide the linear_id by a constant. In order to correctly implement
 * instance divisors, we have to divide linear_id by padded_num_vertices times
 * to user-specified divisor. So first we compute padded_num_vertices, again
 * following the exact same algorithm that the hardware uses, then multiply it
 * by the GL-level divisor to get the hardware-level divisor. This case is
 * further divided into two more cases. If the hardware-level divisor is a
 * power of two, then we just need to shift. The shift amount is specified by
 * the shift field, so that the hardware-level divisor is just 2^shift.
 *
 * If it isn't a power of two, then we have to divide by an arbitrary integer.
 * For that, we use the well-known technique of multiplying by an approximation
 * of the inverse. The driver must compute the magic multiplier and shift
 * amount, and then the hardware does the multiplication and shift. The
 * hardware and driver also use the "round-down" optimization as described in
 * http://ridiculousfish.com/files/faster_unsigned_division_by_constants.pdf.
 * The hardware further assumes the multiplier is between 2^31 and 2^32, so the
 * high bit is implicitly set to 1 even though it is set to 0 by the driver --
 * presumably this simplifies the hardware multiplier a little. The hardware
 * first multiplies linear_id by the multiplier and takes the high 32 bits,
 * then applies the round-down correction if extra_flags = 1, then finally
 * shifts right by the shift field.
 *
 * There are some differences between ridiculousfish's algorithm and the Mali
 * hardware algorithm, which means that the reference code from ridiculousfish
 * doesn't always produce the right constants. Mali does not use the pre-shift
 * optimization, since that would make a hardware implementation slower (it
 * would have to always do the pre-shift, multiply, and post-shift operations).
 * It also forces the multplier to be at least 2^31, which means that the
 * exponent is entirely fixed, so there is no trial-and-error. Altogether,
 * given the divisor d, the algorithm the driver must follow is:
 *
 * 1. Set shift = floor(log2(d)).
 * 2. Compute m = ceil(2^(shift + 32) / d) and e = 2^(shift + 32) % d.
 * 3. If e <= 2^shift, then we need to use the round-down algorithm. Set
 * magic_divisor = m - 1 and extra_flags = 1.
 * 4. Otherwise, set magic_divisor = m and extra_flags = 0.
 *
 * Unrelated to instancing/actual attributes, images (the OpenCL kind) are
 * implemented as special attributes, denoted by MALI_ATTR_IMAGE. For images,
 * let shift=extra_flags=0. Stride is set to the image format's bytes-per-pixel
 * (*NOT the row stride*). Size is set to the size of the image itself.
 *
 * Special internal attribtues and varyings (gl_VertexID, gl_FrontFacing, etc)
 * use particular fixed addresses with modified structures.
